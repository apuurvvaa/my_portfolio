# my_portfolio

Project Description:

The goal of this project is to build a portfolio website for showcasing personal projects, skills, and experience. The website will be built using a combination of Typescript, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and FramerMotion.

The website will feature a sleek and modern design, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, will be used to style the website, providing a fast and efficient way to create beautiful and responsive layouts.

React will be used to build the user interface, providing a fast and efficient way to build dynamic and interactive components. Next.js will be used to handle server-side rendering, optimizing the website's performance and providing a smooth user experience.

FramerMotion will be used to add subtle animations to the website, providing a polished and dynamic feel to the user interface. Typescript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, will be used to write the code, providing a safer and more scalable way to build applications.
