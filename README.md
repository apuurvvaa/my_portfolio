# my_portfolio
ReactJS was used to create a portfolio website, and only a few libraries went into its distinctive design, including Framer-motion for smoother animations and page transitions, styled components for styling, and ParticleJS for interesting background elements.
The website showcases past projects, experience, and skills, using React as the front-end JavaScript library for building the user interface. This will allow us to create reusable components and efficiently update the DOM. Bootstrap as the CSS framework was also used for styling the website which gave access to a wide range of pre-designed components and layout options, making it easier to create a visually appealing and responsive website. 
The features include a landing page with a brief introduction and an overview of the skills and experience, a portfolio section featuring past projects with descriptions and links to live demos or code repositories, a contact form for visitors to get in touch with the developer, a blog section for the developer to share their thoughts and experiences on web development
